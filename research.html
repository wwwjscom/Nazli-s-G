	          Most computer crime traditionally has been the "insider" problem.  In fact after virus, i.e., malicious code, insider abuse, called misuse, is the second most threatening attack.  We focus the problem on misuse of search systems.
											                       Misuse detection is an attack to the system by an authorized user who is misusing their privileges. Prior work on misuse detection mainly focused on using logs and user profiles. Profile-based detection systems audit the deviation of user activities from normal user profiles. A user's command history is reviewed based on the percentage of commands used over a specific period of time and logs are mined. We developed algorithms and implemented a misuse detection system by comparing user behavior to user interest profile learned through clustering, relevance feedback, and finally fusion of results of these methods.  We evaluated our system by setting up both an automatic and manual (four human evaluators) evaluation systems and showed a detection rate of over 95%.

									                     With the ever-increasing number of documents on the web, digital libraries, news sources, etc., the need of a text classifier that can classify massive amount of data is becoming more critical and difficult. The major problem in text classification is the high dimensionality of feature space. The Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier is shown to perform consistently better than other text classification algorithms. However, the time taken for training a SVM model is more than other algorithms. We explore the use of the Ambiguity Measure (AM) feature selection method that uses only the most unambiguous keywords to predict the category of a document. Our analysis shows that AM reduces the training time by more than 50% than the scenario when no feature selection is used, while maintaining the accuracy of the text classifier equivalent to or better than using the whole feature set. We empirically show the effectiveness of our approach in outperforming seven different feature selection methods using two standard benchmark datasets.

  Passages can be hidden within a text to circumvent their disallowed transfer. Such release of compartmentalized information is of concern to all corporate and governmental organization. We explore the methodology to detect such hidden passages within a document. A document is divided into passages using various document splitting techniques, and a text classifier is used to categorize such passages. We present a novel document splitting technique called dynamic windowing, which significantly improves precision, recall and F1 measure.

	  Knowledge of relationships among categories is of the interest in different domains such as text classification, content analysis, and text mining. We propose and evaluate approaches to effectively identify relationships among document categories. Our proposed novel method capitalizes on the misclassification results of a text classifier to identify potential relationships among categories. We demonstrate that our system detects such relationships, even those relationships that assessors failed to identify in manual evaluation. Furthermore, we favorably compare the effectiveness of our methods with the state of art method and demonstrate a significant improvement in precision (34%) and recall (5%).

		   Significant portion of the data on the World Wide Web is in the form of HTML pages.  Since content, navigational information, advertisement, and formatting have no clear separation in HTML, the conventional information retrieval systems have the additional task of dealing with noisy data when providing full-text search. A problem that is not well studied is the negative effect of such noise data on the result of the user queries. Removing these data improves the effectiveness of search by reducing the irrelevant results.  Furthermore, we argue that the irrelevant results, even covering a small fraction of retrieved results, have the restaurant-effect, namely users are less likely to return or use the search service after a bad experience.  This is of more importance, considering the fact that an average of 26.8% of each page is formatting data and advertisement.  We developed an algorithm and implemented the system. Our experimental results demonstrated that using extraction reduces the irrelevant results for the queries that generate "bad" results. Our experimental results shows that if one would use a system with extracted text instead of non-extracted text, then a 100% improvement can be achieved on irrelevant results retrieved by the engine based on non-extracted text. On our experiment with cnnfn collection and AOL user queries, we improved all bad results.</FONT>

			With the large volume of data, the task of query processing to identify relevant documents is significantly time consuming. Information explosion demands scalable retrieval systems, motivating the selection of indexing and search algorithms that can support effectiveness and efficiency of the search. By representing an inverted index as a sparse matrix, matrix-vector multiplication algorithms can 
			be used to query the index. As many parallel sparse matrix multiplication algorithms exist, such an 
			information retrieval approach lends itself to parallelism. This enables us to attack the problem of 
			parallel information retrieval, which has resisted good scalability. To improve accuracy, we developed 
			a novel matrix based, relevance feedback technique as well as a proximity search algorithm. We developed 
			a parallel implementation of sparse matrix information retrieval engine using a Beowulf cluster of 16 computers and achieved a substantial efficiency.
