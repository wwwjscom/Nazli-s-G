				<h1>Introduction to Information Retrieval</h1>

				<h2>Course Description:</h2>
				<p>
					Overview of fundamental issues of information retrieval with theoretical foundations. The Information-retrieval techniques and theory, covering both effectiveness and run-time performance of information-retrieval systems are covered. The focus is on algorithms and heuristics used to find documents relevant to the user request and to find them fast. The course covers the architecture and components of the search engine such as parser, stemmer, index builder, and query processor. The students learn the material by building a prototype of such a search engine.
				</p>

<!--
				<h2>Course Goals - Students should be able to:</h2>
				<ul>
					<li>Explain the information retrieval storage methods (Inverted Index, Signature Filesi, Relational Approach)
					<li>Explain the information retrieval evaluation metrics
					<li>Explain retrieval models, such as Boolean model, Vector Space model, Probabilistic model,...
					<li>Explain retrieval utilities such as Parsing and tocken recognition, Stemming, Relevance Feedback, N-gram, Clustering.
					<li>Explain efficiency techniques: compression; index prunning, query thresholding, duplicate document detection.
					<li>Design and implement a search engine prototype using the storage methods, retrieval models and utilities.
					<li>Apply the research ideas into their experiments in building a search engine prototype.
				</ul>
				-->

				<h2>Prerequisite:</h2>
				<p>
					COCS 173 and VERY STRONG Programming knowledge (see the project description!). The class is VERY intensive in projects. If you are not VERY comfortable in programming, you may find this course overly difficult.

				<h2>Project:</h2>
				<p> Students will implement an Information Retrieval search engine. Any programming language may be used. The project is partitioned into several assignments. A search engine prototype will be given to the class that has some functionalities. The students have the option to use this search engine for implementing the functionalities they are required to implement for their assignments. They may however choose not to use this software and write their own engine from scrach. In either case the assignments are the same for the class with the same due dates. The software can be accessed via the Blackboard. </p>

				<h2>Research Paper Presentation:</h2>
				<p>Students in groups select the papers among a set of pre-selected papers. The process and due date for the paper selection will be announced. Each group will be asked to present an overview of the paper. Presentations must be extremely well rehearsed ~V failure to properly prepare for the presentation will result in an extremely poor grade on the presentation. All presentations will be done on the Main Campus. All students have to attend all sessions of the presentations and be active in evaluating each other's presentations. Failing to do so, the student will loose points!</p>

				<h2>Late Assignment Policy:</h2>
				<p> Assignments MUST be submitted on or before their due date. <FONT COLOR = "#C94D4D"><U> No late assignment will be assigned a grade.</U></FONT>In fact the grade for a late submission will be a zero!  Please try not to ask for an extension as no extension will be awarded. If you are not able to finish your assignment by the due date and time, simply submit whatever of the assignment you have done to get some points rather than a zero.  The students are encouraged to re-work on the incomplete assignments within a week from the submission due. This does not change the grade for that assignment, however will be considered if the final grade is in border-line. Note that the re-submission must be a complete work of that project. As the server might be down or other problem may occur while you are planning to submit your work, it is strongly recommended to submit before the due date/time to make sure your submission is successful. Do not forget that this is your responsibility to make your submission on time!  </p>

				<h2>Academic Integrity:</h2>
				<p> Each member of this course bears responsibility for maintaining the highest standards of academic integrity. All breaches of academic integrity will be dealt with severely and must be reported immediately. The student, who cheats (all the involved parties) for the first time receives a zero AND will be disqualified to receive an "A" for the course, regardless of the total points in the semester. In the case of the "second offense" the student receives an "E" grade for the course that is a FAILING grade.</p>
