				Overview of fundamental issues of information retrieval with theoretical foundations. 
				The Information-retrieval techniques and theory, covering both effectiveness and run-time 
				performance of information-retrieval systems are covered. The focus is on algorithms and 
				heuristics used to find documents relevant to the user request and to find them fast. 
				The course covers the architecture and components of the search engine such as parser, 
				stemmer, index builder, and query processor. The students learn the material by building a 
				prototype of such a search engine.

				 CS 331 or CS 401 or CS403 and VERY STRONG Programming knowledge (see the project description!). The class is VERY intensive in projects. If you are not VERY comfortable in programming, you may find this course overly
				                                 difficult. You will need to use a software with several thousands of JAVA code to enhance the software to implement various algorithms that will be given during the semester. For each of these 3-4 projects you have to run many experiments that are very time consuming. ONLY IF you are interested in the course subject AND have either VERY STRONG programming knowledge OR have LOTS of time to allocate in it, should stay in this course.

				Students will implement an Information Retrieval search engine. Any programming language 
				may be used. The project is partitioned into several assignments. A search engine prototype will be given to the class that has some functionalities. The students have the option to use this search engine for implementing the functionalities they are required to implement for their assignments. They may however choose not to use this software and write their own engine from scrach. In either case the assignments are the same for the class with the same due dates. The software can be accessed via the Blackboard.

				</Students in groups select the papers among a set of pre-selected papers. The process and due date for the paper selection will be announced. Each group will be asked to present an overview of the paper. Presentations must be extremely well rehearsed ~V failure to properly prepare for the presentation will result in an extremely poor grade on the presentation. All presentations will be done on the Main Campus. All students have to attend all sessions of the presentations and be active in evaluating each other's presentations. Failing to do so, the student will loose points!

This does not change the grade for that assignment, however will be considered if the final grade is in border-line. Note that the re-submission must be a complete work of that project. As the server might be down or other problem may occur while you are planning to submit your work, it is strongly recommended to submit before the due date/time to make sure your submission is successful.
