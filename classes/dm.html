				<h1>Data Mining</h1>

				<h2>Course Description:</h2>
				<p>
				This course will provide an introductory look at concepts and techniques in the field of data mining. After covering the introduction and terminologies to Data Mining, the techniques used to explore the large quantities of data for the discovery of meaningful rules and knowledge such as market basket analysis, nearest neighbor, decision trees, neural networks, Naive Bayes, and clustering are covered. The students learn the material by implementing different data preprocessing and mining techniques throughout the semester. This is a very project intensive course.
				</p>

				<h2>Prerequisite:</h2>
				<p>
					COSC 173 and VERY STRONG Programming knowledge (see the project description!). The class is VERY intensive in projects. If you are not VERY comfortable in programming, you may find this course overly difficult.
				</p>
				
				<h2>Textbook:</h2>
				<p>
					You should have one of these textbooks-- your choice to choose! Both are very good books:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Jiawei Han and Micheline Kamber, Data Mining Concepts and Techniques, Second Edition (2006), Morgan Kaufmann</li>
					<li>Pang-Ning Tan, Michael Steinbach, Vipin Kumar, Introduction to Data Mining, Addison Wesley (2006)</li>
				</ul>

					</TR> 
				</TABLE>

				<h2>Projects:</h2>
				<p>
					The projects require implementation of data pre-processing and data mining algorithms, and performing experimentations. Any programming language may be used. Student may be called to give a demo for each of the parts of the projects. Failing to appear for the demo, or failing to answer the questions on the submitted project will be a zero for that project.
				</p>
				
				<h2>Research Paper Presentation:</h2>
				<p>
					Students will present an overview of a technical research paper for 20 minutes. The students select the papers among a set of pre-selected papers. The process and due date for the paper selection will be announced. Presentations must be extremely well rehearsed â€“ failure to properly prepare for the presentation will result in a zero, or in the best case, an extremely poor grade on the presentation. All students have to attend all sessions of the presentations and may be asked to evaluate each other's presentations. Failing to do so, the student will loose points!

				<h2>Late Assignment Policy:</h2>
				<p>
					Assignments MUST be submitted on or before their due date. No late assignment will be assigned a grade.In fact the grade for a late submission will be a zero! Please try not to ask for an extension as no extension will be awarded. If you are not able to finish your assignment by the due date and time, simply submit whatever of the assignment you have done to get some points rather than a zero. The students are encouraged to re-work on the incomplete assignments within a week from the submission due. This does not change the grade for that assignment, however will be considered if the final grade is in border-line. Note that the re-submission must be a complete work of that project. As the server might be down or other problem may occur while you are planning to submit your work, it is strongly recommended to submit before the due date/time to make sure your submission is successful. Do not forget that this is your responsibility to make your submission on time!
				</p>

				<h2>Academic Integrity:</h2>
				<p> 
					Each member of this course bears responsibility for maintaining the highest standards of academic integrity. All breaches of academic integrity will be dealt with severely and must be reported immediately. The student, who cheats for the first time receives a zero and in the case of the "second offense" the student receives an "E" for the course, i.e, "Fails". If the student receives a zero as the result of cheating then he/she does not get an "A" for the course, regardless of the total class points earned.
